Project for a data structures course. A shipping corporation with three different vehicle types—normal, special, and VIP—as well as cargoes—is the subject of the project. The trucks with the appropriate cargoes are loaded, and the voyage is simulated along with the distance travelled, the frequency of vehicle inspections, and the number of hours in a day. Since the cargos must be kept in the proper data structures, the project is implemented utilising data structure concepts. For instance, VIP cargo uses a priority queue with the priority based on cost and distance while normal cargo is stored in a queue since it is first come, first served.
